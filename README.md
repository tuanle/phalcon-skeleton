Phalcon Skeleton
========

Getting started
--------

This is a basic skeleton using in a real project based on Phalcon framework (3.4.x)

I don't have many experiences with Phalcon, but because my customer requires building a project with Phalcon, I create a base skeleton for my team (who have never worked with Phalcon too). My goals are:

- Make Phalcon framework easier to understand with new developer.
- Similar structure with Laravel framework (that I and my team have more experience).
- Quick to reuse or extend.

git clone https://github.com/tuanle/phalcon-skeleton.git
